# Privacy Policy for Nada

**Effective Date:** November 25th, 2025

Thank you for using Nada! This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information in conjunction with your access to and use of the Nada mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Data We Collect and How We Use It

### A. Microphone and Audio Data
**Nada** requires access to your device’s microphone to function.
*   **Real-Time Processing:** We use the microphone to detect pitch and amplitude in real-time to convert your voice into MIDI notes. This processing happens locally on your device using our custom audio engine.
*   **Recording:** When you record a track, audio files (`.m4a`) are saved locally to your device's storage within the App’s sandbox.
*   **No Cloud Uploads:** We **do not** upload, stream, or store your voice recordings on any external servers. All audio processing is performed offline on your device.

### B. Location Data
**Nada** requests access to your location ("When In Use").
*   **Purpose:** This is used solely to automatically tag your new projects with the location name (e.g., "San Francisco, CA") to help you organize your ideas, similar to a voice memo.
*   **Storage:** Location data is stored locally in the App’s database (`database.sqlite`) alongside your project metadata.
*   **Optional:** Granting location access is completely optional. The App functions fully without it. We do not track your movements or share your location history with third parties.

### C. User-Generated Content (MIDI & Projects)
The musical data you create (MIDI notes, project settings, tempo, track arrangements) is stored locally on your device.

## 2. Data Storage and Security
*   **Local Storage:** All data (audio recordings, MIDI files, and project databases) is stored in your device's secure Application Sandbox.
*   **User Control:** You have full control over your data. You can delete tracks or entire projects within the App, which permanently removes the associated files from your device.
*   **Backups:** Since data is stored locally, it is included in your standard iCloud Device Backups (if enabled), but we do not have access to these backups.

## 3. Third-Party Services
**Nada** does not integrate with third-party analytics SDKs (like Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel) and does not display third-party advertisements. We do not sell, trade, or transfer your data to outside parties.

## 4. App Permissions
You can revoke permissions at any time in your device Settings:
*   **Microphone:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone > Nada
*   **Location:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Nada

## 5. Children’s Privacy
**Nada** does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. As the App operates offline and does not require account creation, we do not collect age-related data.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
