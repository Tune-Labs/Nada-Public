# Nada Feedback & Support 🎤

Welcome to the official feedback and support hub for the **Nada** iOS app. This is the best place to report bugs, suggest new features, and share your ideas for making Nada the ultimate musical sketchpad for songwriters and producers.

## What is Nada?

Nada is a powerful native iOS application that transforms your voice into a musical instrument. Powered by our custom **Tune Lab Engine**, it bridges the gap between fleeting vocal ideas and digital music production. Whether you are humming a melody, singing a bassline, or beatboxing a drum loop, Nada converts your audio into multi-track MIDI compositions in real-time.

### Key Features

*   **Voice to Melody:** Hum, whistle, or sing to play pianos, synths, guitars, and basses. Our real-time pitch detection and smart quantization ensure you always hit the right notes in your chosen Key and Scale.
*   **Voice to Beats:** Turn beatboxing into tight drum loops. Use the **Beat Mode** to train the engine to recognize your specific sounds—"Boom" becomes a Kick, "Kak" becomes a Snare.
*   **Multi-Track Studio:** Layer your ideas into a full song. Arrange, mute, mix, and tune multiple tracks using the timeline view.
*   **SoundFont Support:** Comes with high-quality built-in sounds, but is fully compatible with standard `.sf2` SoundFonts, giving you infinite instrument possibilities.
*   **Privacy First:** All audio processing happens locally on your device. Your voice recordings and musical ideas are yours and are never uploaded to the cloud.
*   **Export & Share:** Export your creations as standard MIDI files (`.mid`) to use in Logic Pro, Ableton, or GarageBand, or share raw audio renders (`.m4a`).
